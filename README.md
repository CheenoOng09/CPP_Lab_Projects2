# CPP_Lab_Projects2 – Intermediate C++ Labs (CP112)
Solutions to weekly C++ lab assignments from CP112 (Intermediate C++ Labs) during my CS degree.
This repository contains 15 weekly C++ programming projects completed during the **CP112 – Programming Lab 2** course. Each folder from Week 1 to Week 15 includes a different problem focused on intermediate-level concepts such as file handling, sorting, class and object design, data structures, searching, and algorithm implementation.

## Repository Structure

Each week is organized into its own folder:

CPP_Lab_Projects2/
1. Week 1 Manipulating a Linked List
2. Week 2 Class Basics
3. Week 3 Stack Class
4. Week 4 Queue Class
5. Week 5 Data Member Initialization and Class Composition
6. Week 6 Employee Count 
7. Week 7 Operator Overloading for Array Class
8. Week 8 Operator Overloading for Huge Integer
9. Week 9 Inheritance for Bank Account
10. Week 10 Polymorphism for Shapes Part 1
11. Week 11 Polymorphism for Shapes Part 2
12. Week 12 Array Class Template
13. Week 13 Exception Handling
14. Week 14 Bank Account Transactions using Random Access File
15. Week 15 Vector and Map with Iterator


Each folder typically contains:
- `main.cpp` – Source code for the weekly task
- `.txt` files – Sample input/output or test data
- `README.md` – Explanation of the week's problem, input/output format, key concepts, and technologies used (in progress)
- `.pdf` – Original problem statement (if available)

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of C++
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Familiarity with file I/O and debugging

## Notes
- These labs are educational and serve as a record of hands-on learning.
- Most problems are structured to reinforce a specific concept per week.
- Problem descriptions are being gradually documented in each README.md within the week's folder.
